# Verifiable-Computing-AI-Agents

This repository hosts two autonomous AI agent crews built using [CrewAI](https://crewai.io), designed to bring verifiability, integrity, and transparency to AI and decentralized computing workflows. These agents are aligned with FidesInnova’s mission of enabling secure and trustworthy computation in blockchain, IoT, and ML systems.

## 🔧 Agent Crews

### 1. Computation Commitment Manager
This crew manages the creation, registration, and tracking of cryptographic commitments to computational tasks. It ensures that computation requests are recorded in a tamper-proof and verifiable manner using techniques like hash-based commitments and on-chain logs.

### 2. Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Verifier
This crew is responsible for automatically verifying the validity of zero-knowledge proofs submitted by decentralized agents, IoT devices, or smart contracts. It supports modular integration with zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, and custom ZK circuits.

## 🌐 Use Cases
- Verifiable AI pipelines for ML model predictions
- Decentralized ZKP-based authentication for IoT devices
- On-chain computation validation for secure DAO governance
- Agentic AI ecosystems with auditable actions

## 📦 Tech Stack
- [CrewAI](https://crewai.io)
- Python 3.10+
- LangChain
- OpenAI / LLM APIs
- ZKP libraries (e.g., ZoKrates, snarkjs)

## 🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repo and follow the instructions in each crew’s subdirectory to deploy and test their functionality in your agentic workflow.

## 🤝 Contributions
We welcome contributions to enhance agent capabilities, integrate new proof systems, and extend multi-agent coordination patterns.
