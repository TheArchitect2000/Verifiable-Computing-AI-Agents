# Verifiable-Computing-AI-Agents

This repository hosts two autonomous AI agent crews built using [CrewAI](https://crewai.io), designed to bring verifiability, integrity, and transparency to AI and decentralized computing workflows. These agents are aligned with FidesInnova‚Äôs mission of enabling secure and trustworthy computation in blockchain, IoT, and ML systems.

## üîß Agent Crews

### 1. ZKP Integration Crew
This crew manages the creation, registration, and tracking of cryptographic commitments to computational tasks. It ensures that computation requests are recorded in a tamper-proof and verifiable manner using techniques like hash-based commitments and on-chain logs.

### 2. Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Verifier Crew
This crew is responsible for automatically verifying the validity of zero-knowledge proofs submitted by decentralized agents, IoT devices, or smart contracts. It supports modular integration with zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, and custom ZK circuits.

## üåê Use Cases
- Verifiable AI pipelines for ML model predictions
- Decentralized ZKP-based authentication for IoT devices
- On-chain computation validation for secure DAO governance
- Agentic AI ecosystems with auditable actions

## üì¶ Tech Stack
- [CrewAI](https://crewai.io)
- Python 3.10+
- LangChain
- OpenAI / LLM APIs
- ZKP libraries (Fides zk-IoT)
